# Food_Image_Query
Just a rapid proof-of-concept (5 hrs) for my app and practice\
Downsize the database for idea testing. The data is from Food Images (Food-101). You can download it from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/food41
Upcoming Future Work:
1. Train the classification system, so it's more accurate
2. Need to do some sensitivty analysis on the tree for Annoy :)
